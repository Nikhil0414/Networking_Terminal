# Networking_Terminal

This project shows how we can take advantage of Java’s network
class library to quickly and easily write programs that accomplish
many common but unique and time saving networking tasks.
Some of these include:

-help     | SHOW ALL THE AVAILABLE COMMANDS ON THIS TERMINAL

newuser   | LOGIN INTO THE PROGRAM AS A NEW USER

olduser   | LOGIN INTO THE PROGRAM AS AN EARLIER USER

logout    | LOGOUT FROM THE TERMINAL

myip      | GENERATE MY SYSTEM IP & COMUTER NAME

netcon    | TO CHECK INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OF THE USER

filedown  | TO DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM THE URL AND SAVE IT INTO SYSTEM

sendmail  | TO SEND A MAIL ONLY BY USING JAVA NETWORKING

GroupChat | TO RUN THE SERVER TO DISPLAY THE SERVER

Members   | TO SEND MESSAGE TO THE GROUP AS A MEMBER

Dreci     | TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE THROUGH NETWORKING (UDP) PORT

Dsend     | TO SEND THE MESSAGE THROUGH NETWORKING (UDP) PORT

CreCookie | TO CREATE A COOKIE IN A DOMAIN VISIBLE TO SERVER IN DNS

DelCookie | TO DISCARD A COOKIE FROM THE USER SIDE

webpgsrc  | TO VIEW THE HTML CODE OF THE WEB PAGE

webip     | GENERATE HOSTNAME & IP OF URL

URLstats  | DATE, CACHE, CONTENT TYPE, P3P, SERVER, X-FRAME-OPT

checkURL  | CHECK URL AND RETURNS RESULT IN THE FORM OF CODES

URLinfo   | VAILDITY, PROTOCOL, HOST, PORT, PATH, FILE, QUERY

pgtittle  | TO VIEW THE TITTLE ON THE WEB PAGE

exit      | TERMINATE CODE

Conclusion:-
Network programming in Java is one of the topics which remains
underrated or is seen as difficult. But in the real sense it is
completely opposite.
In fact, writing network programs in Java is designed in a way to
make the network processing quite simple and quick.
The Java core API includes well-designed interfaces to most network
features. Indeed, there is very little application layer network
software you can write in C or C++ that you can’t write more easily in
Java.
Hence this project helps to learn and take advantages of the built-in
Networking features in Java and to make the working on the internet
and web easier and quicker.
